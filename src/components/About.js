        <h2>
          I am a recent graduate of UCLA. I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in
          Geology, where I was trained to be a detail-oriented, analytical, and
          collaborative geoscientist. I am well-versed in full-stack development
          and can build user-friendly applications from mock-up to rollout. With
          my background as a scientist and the skills I have learned, I am
          equipped to work collaboratively with a like-minded team to ensure
          optimal results for user-centered and technology-centered designs.
