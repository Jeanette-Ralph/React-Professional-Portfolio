      <h2>
        I am a recent graduate of UCLA. I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in Geology,
        where I was trained to be a detail-oriented, analytical, and
        collaborative geoscientist. I have completed the Full-Stack Web
        Development Coding Bootcamp at UCLA and intend working as a software
        developer. During my time in this six-month bootcamp, I have built
        interactive full-stack applications utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. I am
        well-versed in full-stack development and can build user-friendly
        applications from mock-up to rollout. With my background as a scientist
        and the skills I have learned, I am equipped to work collaboratively
        with a like-minded team to ensure optimal results for user-centered and
        technology-centered designs.
